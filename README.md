# Hello World Collection

This is my collection of "hello world" programs written in various languages
and dialects. In general, the goal is to simply output "hello world" (with no
linebreak) at the command line. There are a few minor exceptions.

## Workstation Setup

I use Mac OS X with `homebrew` as my package manager. The languages that I've
used are either pre-installed with Mac OS X, installed with the Mac OS
Developer Tools or installed with `homebrew`. CoffeeScript requires
the corresponding node module is installed globally.

## Credit

Most of the applications were written by myself with the aid of official
reference materials available freely on the web. The one glaring exception is
the Objective-C example, which I shamelessly stole from [this StackOverflow
question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7473246/compile-an-ios-objective-c-command-line-app-through-gcc-on-mac).
